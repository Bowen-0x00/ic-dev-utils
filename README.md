Common utilities and scripts for digital IC and processor development

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides a centralized collection of commonly used tools and scripts for **digital IC** and **processor design**, including:

* 🧩 **Makefile templates** — support modular compilation and automatic dependency generation;
* 🐍 **Script utilities** — TCL/Python scripts for generating filelists, dumping FSDP, and automating simulation tasks;
* ⚙️ **SystemVerilog utility modules** — simulation-only UART, watchdog, simulation terminator, and other debugging helpers.

**Main goals:**
Rapid prototyping / simulation environment setup / debugging assistance.
